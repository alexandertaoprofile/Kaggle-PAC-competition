1. PAC Competition - Car Price Prediction
Dataset: The dataset used is from the 'How much is your car worth?' competition. It includes various features such as car make, model, trim, fuel economy, horsepower, and more.
Objective: The goal is to predict car prices based on the provided features.
Models Used:
XGBoost
Random Forest
Linear Regression
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) 
Evaluation Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) was used as the performance metric to evaluate the model's predictions.

Steps:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model training and tuning
Cross-validation
Hyperparameter optimization
Final model selection based on RMSE

Scripts & Notebooks
Data Exploration: This includes initial data exploration, identifying missing values, and visualizing correlations between features.
Model Training: Scripts for training models, including XGBoost and deep learning models (TensorFlow/PyTorch).
Feature Engineering: Techniques used for handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and generating new features.
Model Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model evaluation using various approaches.
